Project which inolves bayesian regression analysis and makes use of related R packages - particularly RStan, which is used to approximate the posterior distribution of regression coefficients using MCMC methods.

The aim of the project is to check, whether over 14 years (2000-2014) there have been any meaningful changes to regulations, policies, social attitudes towards CO2 emissions, that would affect the probability distributions of coefficients in a linear model that predicts the country CO2 emissions using GDP per capita, usage of fossil fuels and urbanization.
